## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. More discussion of AutoLayout with labels
2. Discussion about how to create custom search bar
